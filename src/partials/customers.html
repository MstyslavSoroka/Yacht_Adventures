        I rented the Lagoon 620 with my family for a week-long vacation and it
        was the best decision ever. The yacht was spacious, comfortable, and
        luxurious, and the crew took care of everything.

        The Azimut 80 was the most luxurious yacht I've ever been on. The cabins

        relaxing and entertaining. Worth every penny!
